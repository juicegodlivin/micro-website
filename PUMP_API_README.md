# Pump.fun Feed API Integration

## Current Status

The Pump.fun Feed is currently displaying **mock data** due to CORS restrictions on the official Pump.fun API. The interface shows exactly how real tokens would appear once connected to live data.

## Why Mock Data?

1. **CORS Restrictions**: The official `frontend-api.pump.fun` endpoints block browser requests
2. **API Protection**: Pump.fun uses CloudFlare protection (error 1016) that prevents direct access
3. **Browser Limitations**: Cross-origin requests are blocked for security reasons

## Solutions to Get Real Data

### Option 1: Local Proxy Server (Recommended)

I've created a simple Node.js proxy server that bypasses CORS restrictions:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install express cors node-fetch

# Start the proxy server
npm run proxy

# The proxy runs on http://localhost:3001
```

Once running, the dashboard will automatically detect and use the local proxy for real data.

### Option 2: Public CORS Proxies

The code already tries public CORS proxies as fallback:
- `api.allorigins.win` 
- `corsproxy.io`

These may work intermittently but are less reliable.

### Option 3: Server-Side Implementation

For production, deploy the proxy server or implement server-side API calls:

```javascript
// Example server-side endpoint
app.get('/api/pump-tokens', async (req, res) => {
    const response = await fetch('https://frontend-api.pump.fun/coins/trending');
    const data = await response.json();
    res.json(data);
});
```

## Testing Real Data

1. **Open Browser Console** - Watch for API connection attempts and debug info
2. **Check Network Tab** - See which endpoints are being tried
3. **Look for Success Messages** - Console will show "✅ Successfully fetched X tokens"

## Expected Real Data Format

The API returns tokens with this structure:
```json
{
  "mint": "token_address",
  "name": "Token Name",
  "symbol": "SYMBOL",
  "market_cap": 125000,
  "price": 0.000125,
  "bonding_curve_progress": 95,
  "graduated": false
}
```

## Mock Data Features

Even with mock data, you can:
- ✅ Test the complete UI/UX
- ✅ Use filter functionality (All/Graduated/Near Graduation)
- ✅ Click "Trade on Pump.fun" (opens real Pump.fun with sample addresses)
- ✅ See responsive design and animations
- ✅ Experience the full interface flow

## Getting Real Data Working

### Quick Start:
```bash
npm run proxy
```
Then refresh the dashboard - it should automatically connect to real data.

### Debugging:
1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to Pump.fun Feed
3. Watch for connection attempts and error messages
4. Check if proxy server is running on localhost:3001

## Production Deployment

For production with real data:
1. Deploy the proxy server to your hosting platform
2. Update the local proxy URL in the code
3. Add proper error handling and rate limiting
4. Consider caching responses to reduce API calls

The interface is fully ready for real data - it just needs a way to bypass the CORS restrictions!
