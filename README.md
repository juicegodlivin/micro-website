# Erevos - Dark Ops AI Intelligence

> AI Agent Stack for Dark Operations - Unfiltered intelligence, real information, and powerful AI tools that explore beyond conventional boundaries.

## Overview

Erevos is an AI agent stack designed to protect users while offering powerful intelligence tools that explore beyond conventional boundaries. We look through the dark places, find real information, and aren't afraid to disagree with you to provide accurate, unfiltered intelligence.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Unfiltered Information Access**: Bypasses conventional content filters and restrictions to access real information from sources others won't touch
- **Dark Web Intelligence**: Sophisticated crawling and analysis of dark web sources, encrypted communications, and hidden services
- **Adversarial Truth Seeking**: Trained to disagree with users when necessary to provide accurate information, even when inconvenient
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-references information across multiple intelligence sources to verify accuracy and detect disinformation
- **Operational Security**: Built-in OPSEC protocols protect user identity while maintaining secure access to sensitive intelligence
- **Real-Time Threat Analysis**: Continuous monitoring and analysis of emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and intelligence developments

### Intelligence Types

- **Geopolitical Analysis**: Unbiased analysis of global events, conflicts, and political developments without corporate or governmental filtering
- **Corporate Intelligence**: Deep investigation into corporate activities, financial irregularities, and business practices that may be hidden from public view
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive vulnerability research and exploit analysis for defensive and educational purposes
- **Social Engineering Intel**: Analysis of social manipulation techniques, propaganda campaigns, and information warfare tactics

### Integrations

- Tor Networks
- OSINT Tools
- Threat Intelligence Feeds
- Dark Web APIs
