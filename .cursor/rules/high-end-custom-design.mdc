  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
  --spacing-lg: 2rem;
  --spacing-xl: 4rem;
  
  --font-size-sm: clamp(0.8rem, 0.17vw + 0.76rem, 0.89rem);
  --font-size-base: clamp(1rem, 0.34vw + 0.91rem, 1.19rem);
  --font-size-lg: clamp(1.25rem, 0.61vw + 1.1rem, 1.58rem);
  
  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);
  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
